00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Play one of the best new FPS shooters,

00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,077
Hi. Todd Maher, eHarmony.

3
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,912
How can I help you today?

4
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,182
Hi. I can't seem to leave
a wink for someone.

5
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,084
I don't know, is my page broken?

6
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,152
Do I... do I maybe have
a broken page or...?

7
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,088
I've never heard
of that, but okay.

8
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,023
You're trying to use
your eHarmony account

9
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,024
for the first time?

10
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,526
I am.

11
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,828
Okay. I'm looking
at your profile.

12
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,297
We have a pretty intricate
matching algorithm.

13
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,866
That's what distinguishes us from
other online dating services.

14
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,701
Yeah, I like that.

15
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,671
Actually, I'm just trying
to leave a wink for one person.

16
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,540
Cheryl Melhoff?

17
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,209
She started in my division
at work about a month ago,

18
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,844
and I overheard her
near the bagels

19
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,279
saying she was on your site.

20
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,314
Okay, that's unique,

21
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,682
but let me ask you,

22
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,183
you left a lot of this stuff,

23
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,853
like... like the "Been There,
Done That" section,

24
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,154
you left it blank.

25
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,789
Yeah, I think I skipped it.

26
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,292
Okay, well, you got to
help me out here, man.

27
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,927
Don't skip stuff.

28
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,797
Okay, well, I haven't
really been anywhere...

29
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,133
noteworthy or mentionable.

30
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,335
Have you...
have you done anything

31
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:32,305
noteworthy, mentionable?

32
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,677
Hello? You still there?

33
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,679
Can you hang on a second?

34
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,288
My God!

35
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,157
Go, go, go! Get out!

36
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,625
Get out! She's gonna blow!

37
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,693
Go! Go!

38
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,797
Chips!
Over here!

39
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,632
Chips!

40
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,300
Thank you! How'd you know
about the building?

41
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,269
I heard barking,
thought I smelled gas.

42
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,937
I hope it's okay.

43
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:08,240
I engineered a prosthesis for Chips while
I was sprinting down the stairwell.

44
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,043
Little hip-joint assembly
with a drop-ring lock

45
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,846
and an anterior pelvic band.
God, you're noteworthy.

46
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,314
I just live by the ABCs.

47
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,249
Adventurous, brave, creative.

48
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,983
That's everything
I want in a man.

49
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,222
My man?

50
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,857
Hey, my man, you still there?

51
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,893
Hey.

52
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,196
What, did you pass out or...?

53
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,398
No, I just, like, zoned out
for a second.

54
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,766
Okay.

55
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,134
Do you do that a lot?

56
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,770
A normal amount,

57
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,006
I guess.

58
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,375
Yeah... I...
I got to run. Sorry.

59
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,176
O- Okay, but we...
we need a lot more...

60
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,283
Hey, bad day to be late.

61
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,785
We just got acquired.

62
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,987
What?
Yeah, over the weekend.

63
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,389
Walter, happy birthday!

64
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,125
He's 42 years old!

65
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,994
Odessa, what are you doing here?

66
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,064
Mom made you your favorite
clementine cake.

67
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,000
Aren't you supposed to be at the retirement
place with her getting the piano moved in?

68
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,735
Yes, I was there.
It's, like, halfway done.

69
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,004
Piano is out of the van,
it's on the street.

70
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,706
Everything's fine,
but I just got a phone call

71
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,075
about a really big audition,
so can you go finish it?

72
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,277
No, I can't; I'm late.
Walter, I...

73
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,746
I don't think you're seeing this
from what I need.

74
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,147
What do you...
What do you need?

75
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,016
<i>I need to be Rizzo in Grease.</i>

76
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,018
I don't understand that.

77
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,753
My audition... Rizzo.

78
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,354
Rizzo?
Rizzo.

79
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,824
She's tough and tender.
Do me a favor, please.

80
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,159
Make sure Mom's piano gets
moved in all the way, all right?

81
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,794
Don't go to Rizzo.

82
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,962
Thanks, Walter.

83
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,764
Happy birthday!

84
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,899
Guess what.
We just got acquired.

85
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,735
Yeah, I heard.
Yeah.

86
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,070
There's gonna be changes,
downsizing of us

87
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,172
into some kind
of dot-com thing possibly.

88
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,807
I wonder how

89
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,042
this thing goes down,

90
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,810
how the transition's
gonna play out.

91
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,445
I could probably tell you.

92
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
Ted Hendricks,

93
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,449
managing director
of the transition.

94
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,085
Hey. Tim Naughton, sales.

95
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,422
Gary Mannheim, graphic design.

96
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:40,326
And what do you do, cake man?

97
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,262
I...

98
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,830
I do the, um...

99
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,931
The cake's just for today.

100
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,166
I'm not a cake man.

101
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,035
I do... I-I deal dirctly...

102
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,772
"Dirctly"?

103
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,074
Directly with,

104
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,475
<i>LIFE's photo units...</i>

105
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,310
I'm sorry, I was really getting
into this song.

106
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,446
I stopped listening to you.

107
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,484
I was saying, you know
who looks good in a beard?

108
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,353
Dumbledore, not you.

109
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,795
Guy...

110
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,430
Guy?

111
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,200
What do you do?

112
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,335
I'm a negative asset manager.

113
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:28,107
Worth the wait.

114
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,386
Ted.
Donny.

115
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,922
You feeling tough?
Feeling good.

116
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,191
Well, got to make
some tough calls ahead.

117
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,525
You've been here before, yeah?

118
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,993
Yeah, so this is it?

119
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,461
Yeah, the house of pictures.

120
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,206
Hey.

121
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,373
Hi.

122
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,541
How was your weekend?

123
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,610
I...
I had an awesome weekend.

124
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:24,163
And what did you do this weekend?

125
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,432
Um, let's see.

126
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,969
I bathed in Arctic mountain water

127
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,238
while my Latin lover
recited verse to me.

128
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,939
You slut.
I know.

129
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,309
Actually, I waited for my refrigerator
repairman who never came.

130
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,644
I'm so sorry.

131
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,079
I'm gonna call you later.

132
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,512
Okay.

133
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,518
The ice, yes?

134
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,386
She moves like a woman.

135
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm Walter. Mitty.

136
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,160
Cheryl. Melhoff.

137
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,462
Where have you been?

138
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,131
Testing the limits
of the human spirit.

139
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,667
I'd like to climb your hair,

140
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,335
test that out.

141
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,603
Perhaps I can contact you

142
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,306
possibly through
my poetry falcon.

143
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,474
Poetry falcon.

144
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,074
I like that.

145
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,483
Do you think if I hit him with
a paper clip, would he move?

146
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,617
Yeah, I don't know.

147
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,387
Do it. Hello.

148
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,956
I actually threw
a toner box at him once.

149
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,157
Yeah? Did he move?

150
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,359
No, I-I missed.

151
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,495
That's a great story.

152
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,364
Ground control to Major Tom.

153
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,299
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

154
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,441
Wow.

155
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,346
- Moving on, as they say.
- Yeah.

156
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,481
Conference room,

157
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,517
more of these stations here

158
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,052
where people sort of
do their thing.

159
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,752
Layouts here for...

160
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,165
Morning, Hernando.

161
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,100
There's a new nut pouch.

162
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,468
Did you hear?

163
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,203
Yeah.

164
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,005
I... met him.

165
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,373
We're gonna be evaluated.

166
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,607
They won't be able to.

167
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,309
We do intricate
details back here.

168
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,644
Yeah.

169
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,279
It's tricky and bewildering.

170
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,548
I should evaluate you;
you should evaluate me.

171
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,550
I don't think
they'll let us do that.

172
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,683
Just saying.

173
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,557
Hey, how long has
this neg roll been here,

174
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,624
out in the open?

175
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,763
It's a Sean O'Connell.

176
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,131
It came in this morning.

177
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,399
There's a present, too.

178
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,402
He sent you a present
on your desk.

179
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,038
Sean O'Connell
still shoots on film.

180
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,172
That results for me
in a man crush.

181
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,177
Hey, you want to mount these?

182
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,479
Seriously?

183
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,812
Sure.

184
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,693
<i>Heard rumblings LIFE's done, man.</i>

185
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,195
<i>Wanted to say thanks.</i>

186
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,630
<i>Take a look inside.</i>

187
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,433
<i>A gift for all the years
of hard work.</i>

188
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,402
<i>Sorry about the neg roll.</i>

189
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,739
<i>I spilled some blood on it while
self-stitching a gun wound to my abdomen,</i>

190
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,309
<i>but number 25 is my best ever.</i>

191
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,745
<i>The quintessence of LIFE,
I think.</i>

192
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,581
<i>I trust you'll get it
where it needs to go.</i>

193
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,482
<i>You always do.</i>

194
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,771
What'd you get?

195
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,907
Um, it's a wallet.

196
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,583
<i>With LIFE's motto on it.</i>

197
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,860
Here you go.

198
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,568
Where's 25?

199
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,769
It's not there.

200
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,439
Hey.

201
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,408
We need negative 25.

202
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:32,611
Sean O'Connell sent a telegram.

203
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,812
An actual telegram.

204
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,814
A 100-year-old dude came
in a little hat.

205
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,550
So there's a floor meeting.

206
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,651
Bring 25.

207
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,591
It-it's here somewhere.

208
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,892
We'll find it.

209
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,861
Okay, make a contact sheet
of these frames

210
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,330
as soon as you can, and don't
say anything to anyone.

211
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,464
Yeah.

212
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,700
I just wanted to inform you all,

213
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,834
reluctantly, that...

214
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,576
I guess just start back
from the beginning.

215
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,245
Okay.

216
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,846
I just wanted to inform you all

217
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,682
reluctantly that,
this month's issue

218
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,384
will be our last.

219
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,519
What?

220
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,220
Yeah, what?

221
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,556
- That's some bull.
- Yeah.

222
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,523
Sad...

223
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,896
news for sure.

224
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,498
Now, you're all valued employees,

225
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,534
but as we undergo this transition

226
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,202
<i>to, LIFE Online,</i>

227
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,638
we wanted to be candid
with you that,

228
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,641
some of you will be determined
non-vital employees

229
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,409
to the new...
the new partnership,

230
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,479
and we'll be deciding which of those
positions will be remaining with us

231
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,481
over the course of the next week.

232
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,717
Also, we feel sad about that,

233
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,386
as you can see.

234
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,655
Now, for some good news.

235
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,357
We are very excited for...
All right, Don.

236
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,427
Ted Hendricks, managing director
of the transition.

237
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,963
Never fun, this stage.

238
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,899
But we do have ahead of us

239
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,635
the privilege
of publishing what will be

240
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,905
<i>the very last issue
of LIFE magazine.</i>

241
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,674
And for the final issue,

242
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,743
we just received a telegram...
come on...

243
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,745
from Sean O'Connell,

244
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,814
who has never, I'm told,

245
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,217
been willing to speak
with the executives here.

246
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,285
Well, he broke his long silence

247
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:24,890
and shared his thoughts with us
through that... that old man.

248
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,793
Sean O'Connell.

249
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,394
"I expect full consideration

250
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,265
"of negative 25 for cover.

251
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,267
"My most grand,

252
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,936
<i>the quintessence of LIFE."</i>

253
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,906
The... what is that?

254
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,741
What-what is that?
It means, like, the fullest

255
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,476
and most rich.
Okay.

256
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,545
So our cover will probably
be the most famous ever

257
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,648
because it really will have the
big quintessence of all time.

258
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,717
Very full and so rich.

259
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,522
So let's see this thing?

260
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,957
Let's see it.

261
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,792
Can we... What do we...
What am I doing up here?

262
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,261
What's going on?

263
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,462
We'll receive it now
from Negative Assets.

264
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,563
This gentleman here.
Negative Assets.

265
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:05,631
Last man in.
What's that?

266
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,566
Major Tom.

267
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,734
Can I,

268
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,635
get that?

269
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,941
It's, being processed.

270
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,643
All right, well, let's do it.

271
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,511
Let's process some quintessence.

272
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,513
Come on.

273
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,348
Go.

274
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,883
Now.

275
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,618
That's why I'm clapping.

276
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,719
Wait, when do we go to press?
Two and a half weeks.

277
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,025
Please don't worry.
You're going to be fine, okay?

278
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,693
You've been here forever;
I'm sure he won't...

279
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,995
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.

280
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,498
It was nice talking to you.

281
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,533
Well, guess I'll talk
to you later. Okay.

282
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,468
Hi.

283
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,637
Hi.
Hi.

284
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,773
I'm, Walter.

285
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:48,874
Cheryl.

286
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,542
Mitty.
Melhoff.

287
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,911
Yes, You...

288
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,013
you work in Photo Accounts,
right?

289
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,315
I do.

290
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,382
Negative Assets.

291
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,817
Yes. I'm...
Yeah.

292
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,786
Processing the last cover photo.

293
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,521
That's-that's a big deal.

294
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,855
Yeah, it's... there's...

295
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,023
We have a glitch.

296
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,692
Mini on that one right now.

297
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,327
I wanted to say to you,

298
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,594
do you maybe

299
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,998
have an address
for Sean O'Connell?

300
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,767
Um, it's not really
that easy with him.

301
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,769
He moves around so much.
I don't.

302
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,904
Yeah, he's on a freelance.

303
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,505
I don't know where,

304
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,441
and he doesn't have a phone.

305
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,909
No phone? He's old-school.

306
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,976
Yeah.

307
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,878
Well...

308
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,747
Um, but, you know, um,

309
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,048
why don't I check with Peg?

310
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,917
I know she just processed
a check for him,

311
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,719
and we could track
his payout, maybe,

312
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,953
find him that way?

313
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,054
Cool.

314
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,656
Very cool.

315
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,824
Okay.
Okay. Walter.

316
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:39,825
- Yes.
- All right.

317
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:40,826
All right.
I'm on it.

318
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:41,827
Okay.

319
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:42,994
Thanks.

320
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,396
Yes, okay.
Are you coming?

321
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,964
Yes, I'm not.

322
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,532
Yes, I have to stay.

323
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,168
Here's the contact sheet.

324
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,011
What do you see?

325
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,747
This photo cluster, these three,

326
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,815
they're the only printable ones.

327
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,518
He took them around
the same time he took 25.

328
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,754
They could give us a clue
to where Sean is.

329
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,088
Blow them up, all right?

330
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,589
Cool.

331
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,407
Hey.

332
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,508
Walter, right?

333
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:34,146
Yeah.

334
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,914
So I called Peg about Sean.

335
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,549
She's gonna get back to me.

336
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,818
Hey, thanks.

337
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,153
Cool glasses.

338
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,155
Very Sand People.

339
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,756
These? These are...

340
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,758
No, these are loupes.
They're for work.

341
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,693
They magnify the...
Is that 25?

342
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,928
Can I see?

343
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,096
That's, no.

344
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,932
I can't quite find 25

345
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,734
just now.

346
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,136
You can't find it?

347
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,005
Yeah, that's why
I'm trying to find Sean.

348
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,007
I'm trying to track him
down somehow

349
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,509
with, these other images.

350
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,445
His whereabouts?

351
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,945
Yeah.

352
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,484
I take this class,
Writing the Mystery Novel.

353
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,885
Anyway, they say the key

354
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,487
is to work backwards.

355
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,690
You connect the clues and then
scatter them so they seem unrelated.

356
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,625
There's, like,
a whole science to it.

357
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,726
May I?

358
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,794
Sure.

359
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,629
Okay.

360
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,897
Thumb.

361
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,666
Yeah, it's a...

362
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,534
It's an unknown thumb.
Okay.

363
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,968
Water?

364
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,206
Just water, I guess?
Yeah, just water.

365
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,974
Okay.

366
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,777
And, um...

367
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,480
like, a curved piece of...

368
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,149
some kind of part of a thing.

369
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,220
But, hey, you know,

370
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,189
the thing with clues, my teacher says,
is you really only need one good one

371
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,124
and then they'll connect,
and you'll be like,

372
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,560
"Yes, of course,
unknown thumb, water.

373
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,762
I should've seen this
the whole time. "

374
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,564
Yeah, yeah, I'll be like,

375
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,632
like...

376
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,671
Well, anyway, I should get back

377
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,306
and try not to get fired.

378
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,279
Hey, Cheryl?

379
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,751
I have something creative
I've been working on, too.

380
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,920
A little side project.

381
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,694
Walter, it's amazing.

382
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,663
Walter.

383
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,900
I was just saying I'll let you
know when I hear back from Peg.

384
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,568
Okay.

385
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,769
Thank you.

386
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,213
Hey, Odessa.

387
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,748
What?

388
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,692
Is there a larger
apartment available

389
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,193
the piano could fit in?

390
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,763
'Cause that's a memento
of our mom's.

391
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,599
That's a really big...

392
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,602
Most people sell their really big
mementos before they move here.

393
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,071
My dad bought it for her
the year they were married,

394
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,273
and it means a lot to her.

395
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,009
That's a villa.
It's a little more costly,

396
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,611
but it has a more generous,

397
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,813
piano kind of size living room
for you, though.

398
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,348
Yeah.
Yeah, this is good.

399
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,084
On move-in, you'd need first month's,
last month's and full deposit.

400
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,119
That's, $4,700.
Great.

401
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,754
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, we'll take it.

402
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,989
I'll get the paperwork.

403
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,124
The new villa comes open
in three weeks.

404
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,326
I'm guessing.

405
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,695
Okay.

406
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:38,362
Happy birthday.

407
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,033
Stretch Armstrong!
Stretch Armstrong.

408
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,668
That's cool.
Yeah.

409
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,003
Isn't that awesome?
Wow.

410
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,905
This was your favorite thing
when we were little.

411
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:47,939
Do you remember?
Yeah.

412
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,040
You want to do it?

413
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,342
Yeah, all right.

414
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:51,876
Come on, Stretch!

415
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,111
Good, good!

416
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:54,646
Okay, come on, we got to go.

417
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,914
<i>A villa, okay,</i>

418
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,649
but hey,
I'm not the Queen of Sheba.

419
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,217
You got to have room
for your piano.

420
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:02,320
You can stay at my place until it's ready.
Well, I won't be cramping your scene.

421
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,122
My scene? No.
Yeah.

422
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,157
And I'm sorry we couldn't
get you in here today.

423
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,225
Walter!

424
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,793
Look what I found!

425
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,763
Th-This is from you
and Tim Linderman.

426
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,099
Did you remember,
we were gonna backpack Europe?

427
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,767
That June Dad died?

428
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:16,868
Man!

429
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,903
What is in here?

430
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,672
That's my Walter box,
so those are my

431
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,207
Walter knickknacks and keepsakes.

432
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,675
You made the best mix tapes.

433
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,276
Man.

434
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,245
What? What's that?

435
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:29,114
Travel journal Dad gave me.

436
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,683
You should donate that...

437
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,818
because you never used
it... to a poor kid.

438
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,787
A poor kid who's
going to travel to Europe?

439
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,689
What... Look at you and your dad.

440
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,124
Is that my tournament one?

441
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,160
He was so proud of this.

442
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,664
Sharing your accomplishments
with the whole world.

443
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:48,033
<i>It's from the
Fairview Smalltowner, Mom.</i>

444
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,869
Well, I really liked
that nifty Mohawk.

445
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,171
You know, when your daddy died,
and then you went

446
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,773
to work in that pizza place,

447
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,709
the one that was named
after a father...

448
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,711
had that father kind of name.
Papa John's.

449
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,980
Yeah. Delivery.
And I thought perhaps

450
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,449
that it-it was really sad
for you working in a restaurant

451
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,251
named after a father,
after your father just died.

452
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,820
I never even thought about that.

453
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:12,791
Probably 'cause I didn't
call Dad "Papa. "

454
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,459
You had a weird style.

455
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,362
That wasn't my style.
That was a uniform... KFC.

456
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,164
My worker bee.

457
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,966
Aw.

458
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,003
"Word in the water"?

459
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,805
Okay, you know what?
I got to go.

460
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,807
We're getting you
into a villa situation, okay?

461
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,208
Okay.
Good, everybody?

462
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,210
My worker bee
and my performance artist bee.

463
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,410
Aw, thank you, Mom.

464
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,784
Hernando.

465
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,986
Hey.

466
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,154
I don't see anything.

467
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,422
Upper middle.
It's faint.

468
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,957
There's a word in the water.

469
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,297
I'm getting nervous, Walter.

470
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,769
Hey, this is an ocean.

471
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,037
That's a boat.

472
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,306
<i>"Erkigsnek. "</i>

473
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,142
He was near this boat.

474
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,045
See you in a few.

475
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,112
I'll check the mailroom.

476
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,455
Final cover.

477
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,191
Big responsibility.

478
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,026
Is that my quintessence?

479
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,828
This is... No.

480
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,830
We're, um... we're prepping

481
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,866
the wetting agents
on that to start the process.

482
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:30,769
Really? Because it looks like
you're playing with toys.

483
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,972
No, this is...
this is a gift.

484
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,907
Yeah, um, the negative needs

485
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,475
to go through a very
technical... I'm sorry.

486
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,844
I can't have a professional
conversation with you.

487
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,448
You and your little blond pal.

488
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,850
Okay.
Let's...

489
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,952
You can't walk through
the office with him?

490
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,188
Let's have it.
So I'll put it away.

491
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,157
Give me the toy, man.

492
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,424
No.
Now.

493
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,260
Hey! This is a place of business,

494
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,295
not a place
of jelly-man toys.

495
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,463
Get off it!

496
00:24:58,464 --> 00:24:59,964
No, I'm taking it!

497
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,933
You can't just take my stuff.

498
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,802
It's mine! Give it to me!
No!

499
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,819
Stop fiddling with sweets
and little men!

500
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,521
I'm trying to do my job!

501
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,316
Are you the Tin Man?

502
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,186
Need a little oilcan?

503
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,753
Jesus.

504
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:33,458
Picture.

505
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,431
Hello?

506
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,599
Hey!

507
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,934
Hey.

508
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,102
What's up?

509
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,603
Um, who is this?

510
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,105
Todd, from eHarmony.

511
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,406
Hi.

512
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,241
Yeah, when I lost
you there, I was saying

513
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:53,244
we need to beef your profile up,
make it, you know, not blank.

514
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,546
Real quick, let's build
your "Been There, Done Thats. "

515
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,181
Um, okay.

516
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,084
Been there... um...

517
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,486
Phoenix.

518
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,121
I forgot why.

519
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,223
Then, Nashville,
but that was just the airport

520
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,458
on the way to Phoenix,
so I don't know if that...

521
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,294
Well, hey, man,

522
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,230
I was thinking,
if you work with this girl,

523
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:15,500
why don't you just, you know,
humanly invite her out?

524
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,201
No, no, no, I'm...
I'm trying to do,

525
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,971
like, a "Pina Colada Song" thing.
Pina... "Pina Colada Song"?

526
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,373
Yeah, you know, a guy posts
an ad looking for a lover,

527
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,541
and then his wife answers it,

528
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,477
and turns out they were soul
mates and didn't even know it,

529
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,347
and they end up making love
in capes... or on a cape.

530
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,683
It-it's a song? Can you sing
a little bit, just...?

531
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,051
Yeah, you know...

532
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,522
You know that song?
I have to go.

533
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,523
Is that Hall & Oates?

534
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,458
Hey.
Hey.

535
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,693
Is that another clue?

536
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,528
Yeah. This one's okay.
Yeah?

537
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:46,230
There's a boat there, I think.

538
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,666
"Er... kig... "
"Snek. "

539
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,401
<i>Erkigsnek?
Yeah.</i>

540
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,703
Sounds like a real clue.

541
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,037
Yeah, it's the boat's name.

542
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,138
Have you Googled it?

543
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,673
I was on my way to.

544
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,209
Yeah. N-U.

545
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,378
That's the, first two
letters of the port city.

546
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,148
Buffering.

547
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,118
So... the park.

548
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,320
I got to run up there
and pick up my son.

549
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,389
He's skateboarding with a friend.

550
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,690
Do you want to walk up with me?

551
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,260
Starting now?

552
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,595
Yeah, starting now.

553
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:18,730
Okay.

554
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:20,365
Yeah, we got to figure this out.

555
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,466
It's a big deal.

556
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,568
You lost a Sean O'Connell.

557
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,470
Yeah, I used to work at Nabisco.

558
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:29,574
And then I had
a... change,

559
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,642
<i>and I decided to apply to LIFE.</i>

560
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,144
Thought it would be

561
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,747
more colorful,
less regular, I guess.

562
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:38,683
You know, I just like
the idea of it.

563
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,252
Um, I like the motto
of the company.

564
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,320
Do you know it?

565
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,022
"To see the world... "

566
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,323
"Things dangerous to come to... "

567
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,657
"Things dangerous
to come to... " Yeah.

568
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,559
"To see behind walls... "
Yeah.

569
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,829
Yeah, I, um...
I got this from Sean.

570
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,766
He gave this to you?
Yeah.

571
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:00,670
I like that: "to draw closer. "

572
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,176
So, what's he like in person?

573
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,744
Sean?
Yeah.

574
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,214
Well, I haven't actually met him.

575
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,351
I... I mean,
we talk a lot, but I've...

576
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:16,187
I've been his point guy here
ever since I started.

577
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,756
How long ago was that?

578
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,359
16 years.
16 years?

579
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,760
My gosh. Wow.

580
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,562
Well, you have nothing
to worry about.

581
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,264
With the layoffs, I mean.

582
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,166
I've been here for a month.

583
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,234
"Last in, first out," right?

584
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,772
Sorry.

585
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,441
It's Rich's dad.

586
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,843
It's your...
Um...

587
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,746
Former... newly former.

588
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:45,183
But we've been sort
of... I don't know.

589
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:47,851
You know, I don't need to get it.

590
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,790
So, what kind of skateboard
does your son have?

591
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,359
Um, I have no idea.

592
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,128
It's oblong.
I don't know.

593
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,596
Why?

594
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:01,432
No, I just, um...
I used to...

595
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,401
I was kind of into the scene.

596
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,169
Like...

597
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,370
The skateboard scene?

598
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,406
Yeah.
Wow.

599
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,208
Hi, Peg.

600
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,542
Yeah, Sean O'Connell.

601
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,577
We actually, need to find him.

602
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,681
Yes.

603
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,316
If you could hurry.

604
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,118
Kickflip.

605
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,519
Yeah.

606
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,155
It's a good one
for the repertoire.

607
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,556
I'm Walter.

608
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,391
Rich.

609
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,894
Yeah, we think he might know
something or have an asset we need.

610
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,429
You know, you just got to get

611
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,764
a little more snap,
get that thing up there.

612
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,233
Want me to,

613
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:36,501
show you something?

614
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,468
Sure.

615
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,472
Here.

616
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,608
Like your trucks.

617
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:46,377
Thanks.

618
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,779
Check this out.

619
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,181
Know about the flick?

620
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,252
Yeah, we-we-we've finished
processing his April work order.

621
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:03,461
Yes, it's kind of important.

622
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,761
Okay.

623
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,734
Did you forward the job 1090's?

624
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:12,837
Or his last salary?

625
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,338
Wow!

626
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,705
Okay.

627
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,277
Wow.

628
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,611
Here you go.
That was awesome.

629
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,480
So it could be either place.

630
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:23,614
Thanks, Walter.
Okay.

631
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,783
Thanks, Peg.
All right.

632
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,885
Hey. So, um...

633
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,687
Sean's definitely
not in New York.

634
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,455
Peg said she sent multiples.

635
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,691
I don't know if you know
how it works with him.

636
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,494
She sends copies 'cause we never
know where's he's going to be.

637
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:39,697
And this week, she sent 1090's
to Princeton, New Jersey.

638
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,933
Great. Train ride.

639
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,401
And one to Greenland.

640
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,769
Just in case.

641
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,638
Greenland, the country?

642
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:52,243
That's, um... you can't take
a train there.

643
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,644
No.

644
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,546
Well, maybe he's in Jersey.
Yeah.

645
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,648
Yeah, is your phone done
buffering with that ship's name?

646
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,317
Um, yes.

647
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,785
Look. Here it is.

648
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:02,787
Nuuk, Greenland.

649
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:03,988
That's...

650
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,656
Yeah.

651
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,458
Come on, that's a good lead.

652
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,260
You should follow that up.

653
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,929
Yeah, follow it up in Greenland.

654
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,398
Yeah. Why not? Go.

655
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,000
Crack the case.

656
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,702
Listen to your wallet.

657
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:23,608
Sorry. It's my, um...
it's Phil again.

658
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,643
Um, maybe he fell
down a well or something.

659
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,744
Maybe I should get it.

660
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,279
Hey, buddy. Here.

661
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,981
Rich, Rich, Rich!
Not so fast. Here, here, here.

662
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:32,283
Take that. Take that.

663
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,551
Yeah.

664
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,986
I understand.

665
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,354
Okay.

666
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:37,855
Bye.

667
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,957
He did fall down a well.

668
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,959
But I don't care.

669
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,629
I just want to be with you,
you know?

670
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,730
Really?

671
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,398
Let's run away together.

672
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,433
Let's make every moment count,
starting now.

673
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,435
Sweet.

674
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,970
Can I tell you something?

675
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,070
Anything.

676
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:58,376
I have that
Benjamin Buttons thing.

677
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:02,013
Where you get old
but smaller or whatever

678
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,515
and become a gradual
old baby or something.

679
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:05,750
I didn't see the movie,

680
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,485
so I don't really know
how it works.

681
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,686
But I have it.

682
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,722
We can still build
a life together.

683
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,390
Cool.

684
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,939
I like your snappy little suit.

685
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,043
I bought it at a doll store.

686
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:35,012
Cool.

687
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,483
My little heart
is no bigger than a quarter,

688
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:43,321
but it's as full as Fort Knox.

689
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:45,790
You're the bravest man
I've ever known.

690
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,792
I love you, baby.

691
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:51,028
Not like "baby," like,

692
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,498
because you look
like a little weird baby-man.

693
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,768
I get it.

694
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,905
Thank you for such
a wonderful life.

695
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,974
You're... I...

696
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,109
Shh.

697
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:08,045
Just nestle in here and die.

698
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,950
Good-bye, Walter.

699
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,885
<i>Good-bye, Walter.
Bye! Walter!</i>

700
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,022
Walter.

701
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,590
Bye.
Sorry.

702
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,791
I was just...

703
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,727
Where do you go?

704
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,529
I- I started, thinking about...
No, it's okay.

705
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,798
I was probably boring you
about my broken refrigerator.

706
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,067
No.
Rich!

707
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,970
My son's running into
the street. I-I have to go.

708
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,739
Yeah.

709
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,075
I wanted to tell you, um,
that song, "Major Tom,"

710
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,144
back there,
when the beard guy was...

711
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,947
he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

712
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:47,585
That song is about courage
and going into the unknown.

713
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,252
It's a cool song.

714
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:54,791
Rich!

715
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,570
Yo.

716
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,773
Where's my thing?

717
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,808
It's in a silver bath.

718
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,845
I don't even know what language
you're speaking right now.

719
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,714
You know, you got to
take me seriously.

720
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:18,582
I got a magazine to execute here.

721
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,618
And bosses to answer to.

722
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,654
So next time I see you,
I see that picture. Okay?

723
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,923
Hey, dream machine.

724
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,459
Hello?

725
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,527
I just... I-I want proof
you heard me.

726
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:33,897
Next time I see you...

727
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:36,534
You see the picture.

728
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,902
That's right.

729
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,478
Any luck, Hernando?

730
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,747
I turned the place
upside down... 25's not here.

731
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,848
I searched Receiving, too, man.

732
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,553
This never happens.

733
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,188
I'm telling you,

734
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:58,721
it's nowhere, Walter.

735
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:03,861
I mean, maybe he didn't
even send it.

736
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,229
Maybe it's still on him.

737
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,966
Walter?

738
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,927
Walter!

739
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,247
Hi.
Hi.

740
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,117
Do you have any cars available?

741
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,354
Yeah.

742
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:45,988
We have a blue one and a red one.

743
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,961
I'll take the red one.

744
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,991
Hi.
Hi.

745
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,392
Can I ask you...

746
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,761
Could-could someone
receive mail here?

747
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,096
An American?

748
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,698
Sean O'Connell?

749
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,900
I think he might have
received mail at this address.

750
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,935
You want a drink?

751
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:08,372
Okay, yeah.
I guess...

752
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,277
A small beer shoe.

753
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,712
So-so could somebody

754
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:15,779
get mail here?

755
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,048
Heli mail.
Heli mail?

756
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,717
We helicopter mail

757
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,785
to the ships when they pass by.

758
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,887
We are pub and helipad.

759
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,390
<i>Yeah, wait, the, um,
the Erkigsnek?</i>

760
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:28,058
<i>Yeah, Erkigsnek.</i>

761
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,293
<i>Erkigsnek.</i>

762
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,062
We flew mail to her Tuesday.

763
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:33,997
Gonna take it down a little here.

764
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,800
I just want to speak
from the heart.

765
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,802
I lost a good lady.

766
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:42,172
I feel this song is helping me
feel like I'm not alone.

767
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:46,143
Even though I-I pretty much am.

768
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,845
Come on, let's sing it.

769
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,113
Everyone.

770
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,781
Let's sing it together.

771
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:54,918
So, do you know
who-who flies the mail out?

772
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,954
Do you know... do you have,
like, regular pilots or...?

773
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,155
Hey, man.

774
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,456
Just keep going, man.

775
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,391
Hey, I'm...
Sing it.

776
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,493
No, no, thank you.

777
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:03,794
I don't... I'm all right.

778
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,462
Come on, man, go on.
That's...

779
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:08,999
Yeah, I-I know.

780
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,534
I'm just, I'm okay.
Thank you.

781
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:13,003
I'm-I'm on a business trip.
I'm working.

782
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,905
Come on, man,
this song's important to me.

783
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,340
Yeah.

784
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,108
Yeah, I... Okay.
Sing it.

785
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,415
That sucked.

786
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,084
Well... Okay.
Do your work.

787
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,986
You don't have to push.

788
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,487
Can you stop it? Don't poke me.
What if I poke you? What if...

789
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,989
Would you stop it?
Do your work, man.

790
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,490
Don't-don't poke me.
Do your work.

791
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,192
I'm poking you.
What am I doing? I'm poking you.

792
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:37,127
Stop, stop poking me.
Don't poke me!

793
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,365
Hey!

794
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:42,566
Hey, stop!

795
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,002
Come on!

796
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,041
Wait! Wait!

797
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,376
Wait! Your thumb!

798
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,378
I have to talk to you
about your thumb!

799
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,352
<i>Yeah, I flew mail
out to the Erkigsnek Tuesday.</i>

800
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,922
Gave him a ride.

801
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:08,258
He took that photo
of my hand on the stick.

802
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,427
I'm just...

803
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,561
blown away I located your thumb.

804
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,399
There's, like,

805
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,466
eight people in Greenland.

806
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,038
I mean, it's a...

807
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,407
It's a good place
to find a thumb.

808
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:27,845
Don't cheat on your lady, man,

809
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:31,148
when you live in a country that
only has eight people in it,

810
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:33,984
by the way.

811
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,853
So...

812
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,020
You're scrappy.

813
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,289
You're...

814
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,425
You're a...
You're a little scrappy Duncan.

815
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,395
So, you're trying
to find this guy.

816
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,130
Yes, yeah.

817
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,466
Yeah, well, I'm flying
some radio parts out there

818
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:51,200
in, five minutes.

819
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,304
He may still be on the boat.

820
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,941
Really?
Yeah.

821
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:01,110
Maybe you could come with me.

822
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,453
Yeah, or maybe I could...

823
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:12,122
just, you know, call him on the,

824
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,624
on the boat phone.

825
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,425
The boat phone?

826
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,128
Yeah, the phone on the boat?

827
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:21,598
You mean the ship-to-shore?

828
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,367
Yeah, maybe I could just...
I could, you know,

829
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,202
I could ask him
on the ship-to-shore.

830
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:27,104
The radio's broke.

831
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,440
That's-that's why
I'm flying out there now.

832
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,211
You're flying out right now?

833
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:37,180
Just gonna finish my beer.
The weather doesn't look so great.

834
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,415
It's not.

835
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,517
Looks like there's a
storm moving in.

836
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:43,186
Yeah.

837
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,521
A- brewin'.

838
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,123
Yeah.

839
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,991
You're just...
You're just gonna...

840
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,993
finish your beer

841
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,528
and then fly a machine?

842
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,567
Yeah, kind of...

843
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:00,671
I'm kind of nervous
about the storm.

844
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:04,440
I just want to get a coup...
a couple of beers down.

845
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,386
Okay, I'm not gonna go with you.

846
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,654
Okay?

847
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,489
Yeah.

848
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,824
Whatever.

849
00:44:26,396 --> 00:44:28,198
See you, man.

850
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,367
Okay, see you.

851
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:32,435
Okay.

852
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:01,698
Shut up!

853
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:19,349
Hi. Hello, everyone.

854
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,185
Hi...

855
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,787
Hello, Nuuk.

856
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:26,856
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

857
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,093
Okay.

858
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:33,030
This one goes out
to Walter Mitty.

859
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:35,032
He knows why.

860
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:02,913
Hey.

861
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:05,682
Glad you came.

862
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:07,250
You comfortable?

863
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,652
What?!

864
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,520
Are you comfortable?!

865
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:11,855
No!

866
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:14,056
Hold on tight!

867
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,463
Hey! There she is!

868
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:38,548
Where do we land?

869
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,350
We don't.

870
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,419
What?

871
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,353
We don't land.

872
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,902
Okay, Walter.

873
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:01,771
I was gonna drop the radio parts
into the boat.

874
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,473
You take them; they're
right next to you.

875
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,347
These?
Yeah.

876
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:11,548
Just jump in the boat.

877
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:12,549
You got them?

878
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,583
Just jump in the boat?

879
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:14,818
Yeah!

880
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:17,487
Yeah, you're doing great, Walter.

881
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:19,923
What do you mean,
"jump into the boat"?

882
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:21,725
What would be the best way

883
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:24,027
of reaching you to stay in touch?

884
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,328
I don't know.

885
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,663
Wait.

886
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:28,732
What do you mean,
"jump into the boat"?

887
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:30,934
It looks far away.

888
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:32,502
Yeah, but you got to go now.

889
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:35,671
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

890
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:38,574
No!

891
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,945
No, no, no, Walter!

892
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:43,613
I meant the other boat.

893
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:44,880
The little boat.

894
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,425
Help!

895
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,965
Help! Help!

896
00:50:01,966 --> 00:50:03,833
Try to remain calm!

897
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,770
The pontoon boat
is coming for you.

898
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:10,040
You have at least a minute
before you freeze.

899
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,374
What?!

900
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,541
You're safe.

901
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,917
There's something here!

902
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:24,754
There's a fin here, I think!

903
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,824
We are traveling
through a porpoise school.

904
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,393
Don't fear the porpoise.

905
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,796
I don't think it's a porpoise!

906
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,665
I'm telling you, it's a porpoise.

907
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,834
Be friendly.

908
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:40,403
It will protect you
from the sharks.

909
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,738
Okay!

910
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,344
Come here.

911
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,111
Hey.

912
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,848
Hey.

913
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,750
Jesus!

914
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:57,120
Okay, that's a shark.

915
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:58,788
That's what I said!

916
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,890
Jesus!

917
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,727
Stop befriending it!
Kill it!

918
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:07,597
It's not a porpoise!
It's not a porpoise!

919
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,566
Poke his eyes out!

920
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,600
Fight it!

921
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:20,577
My God, my God.

922
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,778
That really happened.

923
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,881
Real face.

924
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:26,883
Sorry for palming your face.

925
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:29,918
I just... My God.

926
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,730
A pilot boat came.

927
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,999
They took him four hours ago.

928
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,901
Before the storm.

929
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:46,436
Took him where?

930
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,037
Iceland.

931
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,672
Is...

932
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,574
Is there any way
that we could radio him?

933
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:52,942
I... It's very important

934
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,811
that I discuss something
with him. I...

935
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:56,913
You jumped into the ocean
with our radio components.

936
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,648
They're lost.

937
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,550
Correct?

938
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:02,585
Yeah, that's correct.

939
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,529
You're American?

940
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,164
Yeah.

941
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:15,899
Excellent.

942
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,600
Fonzie.

943
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,638
Come on, I'll-I'll find you
some dry clothing,

944
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,305
home slice.

945
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:30,980
Will this work for your items?

946
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,115
Yeah.

947
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:33,450
Thank you.

948
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:35,084
Hey, I'll take this, buddy.

949
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,719
Okay.
Hungry?

950
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,555
Sure.
I got some kick-ass cake, man.

951
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:44,127
Thank you.

952
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:45,728
Looking good.

953
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,631
You can keep it.

954
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,066
Hey, this is...

955
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:51,768
Is this...

956
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,503
This is clementine cake.

957
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,605
This is clementine cake;
my mom makes this.

958
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:57,806
Yeah, Sean brought it.

959
00:52:59,108 --> 00:53:00,910
Yeah.

960
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,978
Good.

961
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,828
Is this Sean's?

962
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:21,097
Yeah, he wrapped the cake in it.

963
00:53:21,098 --> 00:53:22,866
This is a shoot itinerary.

964
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:23,967
It's a field itinerary

965
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:26,035
for-for a photo...

966
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,571
Did he say anything
about where he was going?

967
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,240
No, he didn't say much.

968
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:33,510
He was just taking
pictures of these guys,

969
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:37,080
you know, the Chilean deckhands.
He even gave me some tips

970
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,815
for my Instagrams.

971
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:42,118
Facebook friends?

972
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,820
Yeah, sure.
Great.

973
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:45,989
What-what is... what is Eyjaf...

974
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,957
Eyjafallajokull?

975
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,126
Eyjafjallajokull.
Excuse me?

976
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:51,594
Eyjafjallajokull.

977
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,596
What is that?

978
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,532
Well, it's in Iceland.

979
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:56,900
It's a volcano.

980
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,035
A volcano?
Yeah.

981
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:01,771
May 2, that's tomorrow.

982
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,106
Do you think there's any way

983
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,875
that we could possibly land
in Iceland?

984
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,110
Yeah.

985
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,611
Yeah?
Yeah.

986
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:09,946
We have to in the morning.

987
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,581
Great.

988
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,616
'Cause you lost the radio.

989
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,918
Right, yeah, sorry.

990
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,987
I mean, sorry, but that's...

991
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,756
Well, I-I-I just have
to get to Ey...

992
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,558
Eyjafjallajokull.

993
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:23,626
Right. Eyja...

994
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,360
Man.

995
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,132
Hey, I'll see you
on Sesame Street, man.

996
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,326
Okay, you're here,

997
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:57,894
and this is Eyjafjallajokull.

998
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,295
It's, 15 kilometers.
All right, okay.

999
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,697
You can take the shore bike,

1000
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:03,066
but you better get going, man.

1001
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:06,102
Yeah, he didn't write
a time on that clue paper.

1002
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:07,869
No, man, hurry, because of...

1003
00:55:10,873 --> 00:55:13,309
What? I-I don't...
I don't understand.

1004
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,211
What he means, man,
is you have to hurry

1005
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:19,215
because there's a bunch of horny
Chileans who want to go to a strip club.

1006
00:55:19,216 --> 00:55:20,683
There's only one bike.

1007
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:28,658
Hurry, Walter, hurry, run!

1008
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,127
Go! Go!

1009
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:35,297
Stay gold, Pony Boy!

1010
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:41,798
Hello?

1011
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,833
Hey, what's up?

1012
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:46,102
Todd? From eHarmony?

1013
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:48,304
Yeah, yeah, what's up, man?

1014
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:49,772
Not much.

1015
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,140
How have you been?

1016
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,775
Good.
It's, it's early here.

1017
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:53,876
I just got up, man.

1018
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,111
I was thinking about you.

1019
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,212
Where are you?

1020
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:57,780
Los Angeles.

1021
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:00,149
Hey, so your profile

1022
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,884
still hasn't received any winks

1023
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,786
even though I put
that you've been to Phoenix.

1024
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:07,390
I, I jumped
out of a helicopter yesterday

1025
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:11,194
into the ocean
and had a shark fight.

1026
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:13,296
Yeah, yeah, listen,
I was mentioning before,

1027
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:16,165
people who daydream too much,
they're not content...

1028
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,934
No, it was real.
I really did.

1029
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,001
Really?

1030
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,336
I'll put down adrenaline junkie.

1031
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:22,405
Well, what kind of a shark?
Was it like a...

1032
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:25,208
Hey, Todd,
I can't really talk right now.

1033
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:26,809
I'm on my way to a volcano.

1034
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,478
What the...?

1035
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,510
Hey. Hi.

1036
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,046
Hey, you guys...
you guys speak English?

1037
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:42,084
I'm looking for Eldgos Street.

1038
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,152
Eldgos?

1039
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:45,888
Is that a street?

1040
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:47,957
Is this Eyjafjallakuta?

1041
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,158
Eyjafjallakuta?

1042
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,294
Something like that?

1043
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:54,130
Eyyafallakuta?
Eyyaflutakuta?

1044
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,497
Eyftu...

1045
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:01,537
It's a longboard.

1046
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,939
Yeah.

1047
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,140
Is that... What is that?

1048
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,241
Is that, like, Thor or...?

1049
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:06,442
Odin?

1050
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:08,911
Like, a Norse god?

1051
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,011
It's cool.

1052
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:15,251
Hey, would you...

1053
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,420
Would you maybe want
to make a trade?

1054
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:19,654
I know a kid who would
love that board.

1055
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,160
It's cool.
Look, he stretches.

1056
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:27,329
Here, come and check it out.

1057
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:31,267
Yeah, he's fun.

1058
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:34,002
Yeah, lots of stretching fun.

1059
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:40,542
Want to do it?

1060
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,553
Yeah?

1061
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:52,488
Great, great, thank you.

1062
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,440
Hello?

1063
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,250
Hello?

1064
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,259
Hi. Hi.

1065
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,929
Hey, do you...
do you speak English?

1066
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,163
The hotel is closed.

1067
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:38,000
Okay, yeah, um, I'm just...

1068
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,602
I'm trying to find this guy,

1069
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:42,038
this man, Sean O'Connell.

1070
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,106
I think that he possibly,
he might have stayed here.

1071
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:45,675
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1072
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,143
I got a plane for him.

1073
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,711
At 1:00, there.

1074
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:50,179
15 minutes.

1075
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,581
He's at airfield
in Stykkisholmur.

1076
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,450
Yeah, yeah, in the valley,
next town south.

1077
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:56,552
Okay, where is it?
Stykkisholmur.

1078
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:58,487
Tickishoumer.

1079
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,122
Is it straight down that way?

1080
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,427
Okay, thank you!

1081
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,562
It's all right! I know him!

1082
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:52,595
What's going on?
Where is everybody?

1083
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:53,729
Eldgos!

1084
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:54,730
Come, Eldgos!

1085
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:56,565
Eldgos. Eldgos.
Yes, yes!

1086
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,833
What-what does that mean?
Eretion.

1087
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,636
Eretion?
Erection.

1088
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,304
Erection?
Yes! No!

1089
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:04,673
Eruption!

1090
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,908
Eruption?
Yes.

1091
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:20,655
Sean.

1092
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:39,708
Faster! Go faster!

1093
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:44,313
Holy shit! Faster!

1094
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,750
My God!

1095
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:11,740
Thanks for coming back for me.

1096
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,243
I really appreciate it.

1097
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,611
I hope you find your man.

1098
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:16,612
Thanks.

1099
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:18,447
Yeah, there's a motel

1100
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:19,747
near the pizza place there.

1101
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:27,355
Good luck.

1102
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,337
Photographic Accounts.

1103
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,438
Cheryl?

1104
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:17,606
This is Cheryl Melhoff.

1105
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:18,941
Hey, it's Walter. Mitty.

1106
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:22,011
Hey, I walked down
to say hi to you

1107
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:23,946
about an hour ago
and you weren't there.

1108
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:25,447
That's 'cause... guess what.

1109
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,416
I'm in Iceland.

1110
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:28,817
Iceland?

1111
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,919
Wait, w-wasn't it Greenland?

1112
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,855
Yeah, yeah, it was.

1113
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:34,890
: You know that
they're not the same place?

1114
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:36,558
No, no, no,
I- I went to Greenland,

1115
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,894
and then I got
on a fishing vessel

1116
01:06:38,895 --> 01:06:42,064
tracking Sean, and...
and ended up here in Iceland.

1117
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:43,632
You're in Iceland.

1118
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,901
Yeah, at a Papa John's.

1119
01:06:45,902 --> 01:06:48,671
Hey, I got more clues.

1120
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:49,772
What-what did you find?

1121
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:52,508
There's a date that Sean wrote

1122
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,977
and some words on a cake wrapper.

1123
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:57,813
"Rajqawee," "Buzkashi"

1124
01:06:57,814 --> 01:06:59,381
and, "Warlocks. "

1125
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,083
Wait, they have
a Papa John's in Iceland?

1126
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:03,819
Yeah, I just had to...
just left.

1127
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,055
Did you get kicked out?

1128
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:07,890
No, I just needed to leave.

1129
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:10,993
Just the atmosphere and the...

1130
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:13,395
cups.

1131
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:15,664
Hey, I was right on Sean's trail.

1132
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:17,599
Then I lost him.

1133
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,501
Strong little man.

1134
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,603
Thanks.

1135
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:25,641
<i>No. Rajqawees means
strong little man</i>

1136
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:27,676
in, like, 40 Arabic countries.

1137
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:31,113
<i>And Buzkashi is goat hockey</i>

1138
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:32,981
in Central Asia.

1139
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,085
And, "Warlocks... "

1140
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:40,689
Yeah, um, I was hoping
they would connect.

1141
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:45,527
So you said
that you left Papa John's

1142
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,096
because of the cups?

1143
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:49,832
Is there something I should
be aware of as a customer?

1144
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:52,534
No, I just, I worked there,

1145
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:53,969
that's all. I just...

1146
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:57,106
I used to have a Mohawk and,

1147
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:58,841
a backpack,

1148
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:01,844
and I guess this idea
of who I wanted to be

1149
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:04,713
and what I wanted to do.

1150
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,982
And...

1151
01:08:06,983 --> 01:08:08,417
Yeah?

1152
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,486
Nothing, just...

1153
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:14,990
Just, I was pretty close
with my dad,

1154
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:18,727
and he died when I was 17

1155
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,529
on a Tuesday,

1156
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,030
and we didn't have any savings,

1157
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:25,734
so I got a haircut that Thursday,

1158
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:27,770
and, a job,

1159
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:29,604
the same Thursday.

1160
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:33,008
Papa John's?

1161
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,609
Yeah.

1162
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,981
Your dad let you have a Mohawk?

1163
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:41,984
He shaved my head.

1164
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:45,454
That's a good dad move.

1165
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,456
Yeah.

1166
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:50,125
Is it nice there?

1167
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,094
Yeah, it is.

1168
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,429
It's...

1169
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:56,064
It's really beautiful.

1170
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,633
Well, it's pretty sucky here.

1171
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,536
Human Resources has already started
letting some of the staff go,

1172
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:02,704
so it'll be a lot different
when you get back.

1173
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,840
Hey, I picked something up for...

1174
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,544
I think I lost you.

1175
01:09:11,079 --> 01:09:13,715
You know what, I'll catch
you up when I see you.

1176
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,083
Great.

1177
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,652
Okay, all right.

1178
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:17,820
I'll... Okay.

1179
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:19,121
Um, okay, bye, Walter.

1180
01:09:19,122 --> 01:09:21,188
Bye, Cheryl.

1181
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,866
What's going on?

1182
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,701
All the way in.
All the way to the back.

1183
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,736
They shut down two floors.

1184
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:10,304
Why do you look rugged?

1185
01:10:12,574 --> 01:10:14,243
I see you.

1186
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:17,012
Hey! I see you!

1187
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:18,146
What did I say?

1188
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,848
I see you.

1189
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:21,517
The photograph.
Now. Let me see it.

1190
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:22,951
He looked it up.

1191
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,987
There's no such thing
as a "silver bath. "

1192
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:26,622
Listen, there was uncertainty
about the negative.

1193
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:28,123
I thought...

1194
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:29,658
I understood that, hopefully,
it was in Iceland...

1195
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:30,959
It was in your care!

1196
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,628
If you just give me
some more time...

1197
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:34,830
You're fired.
We'll make another cover.

1198
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:35,997
Hey!

1199
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:42,271
More than a million... way more...
negatives have come through my office.

1200
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,839
I have never mislaid one.

1201
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,574
Put it on a plaque.

1202
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:47,276
Hang it at your next job.

1203
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:49,278
Now I got to explain
this to the board?

1204
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:51,880
Yeah, I'm sure Sean
O'Connell will be thrilled.

1205
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:53,715
Hey...

1206
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,751
Tell me again...
who is this guy?

1207
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,119
You okay?

1208
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,555
Yeah.

1209
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:01,056
That's cool.

1210
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:02,758
It's a skateboard.

1211
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,925
It's for Cheryl's son.

1212
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,163
Cheryl's not in.
She was let go.

1213
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:11,099
I told you, man, it's bad.

1214
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,299
Hey! That's my fern.

1215
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:14,402
Thank you.

1216
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:09,457
Hi.
Hi.

1217
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:12,493
Can I...?

1218
01:12:14,262 --> 01:12:16,965
Yeah, is, um...

1219
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:19,368
Is this, um...
I'm looking for Cheryl Melhoff.

1220
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:21,103
You want Cheryl?

1221
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:24,740
Yeah. She's, um...

1222
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,075
We work together,
and she was, she was

1223
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:30,044
helping me with a, um,
with a work thing that...

1224
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,848
Cheryl?

1225
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,086
Honey?

1226
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,055
There's some guy here.

1227
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:42,290
What?

1228
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:44,259
Shh!
Bud, stop it.

1229
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:46,094
From work.

1230
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:48,462
Um, okay, hold on.
I'm on the phone.

1231
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,756
It's Conan.

1232
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:17,292
Tonight,
First Lady Michelle Obama,

1233
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:19,895
Walter Mitty!

1234
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:21,763
Can we... can we talk
about your love life?

1235
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,231
I think people would be interested.
I don't think...

1236
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,933
You don't want to know
about my love life.

1237
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:26,868
I think they do.

1238
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,403
Yeah, I think
they do. Yes.

1239
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,772
Now, I don't believe
everything I read.

1240
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,174
There's a scandal?

1241
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:33,442
Little...
little scandal?

1242
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:35,811
A little scandal, yes.

1243
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:38,914
She was back with her
husband or something...

1244
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,449
then she fell for you?

1245
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:41,783
You know, where there's smoke,
there's fire.

1246
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,186
That's all I'm gonna say.
You're awesome, Walter.

1247
01:13:44,187 --> 01:13:46,188
Well, thanks. Hey, thanks.
Sure.

1248
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:48,223
I don't think
Can you turn this off?

1249
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,225
You realize I am bumping
It stays on.

1250
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:53,328
Dame Judi Dench 'cause I want
to talk to you more.

1251
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:55,930
I'm just going to get out.

1252
01:14:10,178 --> 01:14:13,381
Hey, Mom.
Hi, honey.

1253
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:15,417
Walter, you gotta tip these guys.

1254
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:17,486
We got the piano back safe, Mom.

1255
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:20,789
You back from your work trip?

1256
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,390
Yeah, this morning.

1257
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:23,391
Hungry?

1258
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:27,229
I'm making soup.
Thanks.

1259
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:29,050
Hey, tipping time now.
: Let's go.

1260
01:14:34,936 --> 01:14:36,470
This is all I got.

1261
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,809
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1262
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,144
All right, thanks, everybody.

1263
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:43,512
For all your hard work.

1264
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:44,513
Yeah. We appreciate it, ma'am.

1265
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:45,514
You did great.

1266
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:47,282
You just let yourself out.

1267
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:49,143
- He's good for this.
- What'd I tell you?

1268
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,387
You gonna stay for dinner?

1269
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:54,256
Mom, I'd love to.

1270
01:14:54,257 --> 01:14:55,824
I think I'm just really wiped out

1271
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,492
after supervising moving
that thing all day.

1272
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:00,829
I think I just need to go
to yoga and then just crash.

1273
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,164
What is it? A class?

1274
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:04,166
Yeah, it's yoga.
It's a class.

1275
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,368
I go to the hot kind,
where they heat the room.

1276
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:08,503
Have you heard of that?
Sure.

1277
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,838
You have?
It's good for you.

1278
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,039
It's great for you.

1279
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,507
You just get it
all out of your system.

1280
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,875
You just get all your sweat out,

1281
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:15,377
you just get everything,
all your fear.

1282
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:17,279
I'm waiting on a call
about an audition, and I just...

1283
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,380
<i>Ooh, that Grease show?</i>

1284
01:15:18,381 --> 01:15:19,881
Yeah.
Rizzo?

1285
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:21,116
Yeah. I'm really
excited about it.

1286
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:22,350
I haven't even heard of that.

1287
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,252
But I just
gotta get it... I just...

1288
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:25,520
what's good about this is that
I just don't worry about it.

1289
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,521
Just get out of my head.

1290
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,190
Is that good, too?

1291
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:29,925
I feel like it's good
in a class like this.

1292
01:15:29,926 --> 01:15:32,394
I mean, I'm not going to get
paid for it, which is fine.

1293
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:34,029
It's not about money.
Wonderful.

1294
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,497
And I feel like, you know,

1295
01:15:35,498 --> 01:15:37,165
it's just for kids,

1296
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:40,035
but I think it's important
for them to start early.

1297
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,369
I'm really thrilled, Mom.

1298
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,872
You know, I think I'm just
going to enjoy it.

1299
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,574
Just standing in front
of people and talking.

1300
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:48,210
You'll be good at that. Yeah.

1301
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,312
You'll really be good at that.
I think so, too, Mom.

1302
01:15:50,313 --> 01:15:53,448
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah.

1303
01:15:53,449 --> 01:15:57,551
Did somebody take a picture
of your piano, like, a week ago?

1304
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,190
I did.

1305
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:03,557
With Sean's camera.

1306
01:16:08,129 --> 01:16:09,497
Sean O'Connell's camera?

1307
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,265
Yeah, he came to visit.

1308
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:13,969
Mom, what?

1309
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:16,238
Yeah.

1310
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,173
He wanted to know about
your work schedule,

1311
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:20,208
when you left,
when you came home.

1312
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:22,577
<i>He said you really
understood LIFE.</i>

1313
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,579
He was really interested
in your work.

1314
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,514
You...

1315
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,350
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

1316
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:29,484
I told you.

1317
01:16:29,485 --> 01:16:31,219
I told you in the produce aisle.

1318
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,655
I remember that.

1319
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:35,357
Maybe you were...

1320
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:37,158
Odessa, what is it you call it

1321
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,227
when he goes into
one of his little places?

1322
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:41,129
Zoned out.

1323
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:43,230
You do that now and then.

1324
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:46,133
What's the matter?

1325
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:50,372
I got fired.

1326
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:52,240
I lost a picture of his.

1327
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:54,109
Can you find it?

1328
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,378
No, I don't know where he is.

1329
01:16:56,379 --> 01:17:00,548
He's some... someplace
with warlocks or...

1330
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:03,218
Warlords.

1331
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:04,986
No, warlocks.

1332
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:06,655
No. Warlords.

1333
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:10,325
Sean said he had to meet
with warlords very soon,

1334
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:13,161
and maybe he would take my cake

1335
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:14,663
so that he could get permission

1336
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:17,265
to trek through
the wilds and places.

1337
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:19,267
He said he wants to
photograph snow leopards.

1338
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:20,402
How about that?

1339
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:21,735
Who?

1340
01:17:30,378 --> 01:17:33,747
"Ungoverned Afghanistan. "

1341
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,020
That's where Sean is.

1342
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:42,190
Crazy Afghanistan.
Yeah.

1343
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,993
In the upper Himalayas.

1344
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:47,495
They can't let you go.

1345
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,999
You were Sean's partner.

1346
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,101
He told me that you
were the person

1347
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:54,669
who worked the hardest

1348
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,806
to make sure his work was
realized the way he wished.

1349
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:06,246
You finish his work.

1350
01:21:47,268 --> 01:21:48,436
Hey, Todd.

1351
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:50,238
Hey, what's up?

1352
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,639
Not much.

1353
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,840
Hey, good news.

1354
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:55,410
Your profile
really rounded out, man.

1355
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:57,412
That-that volcano-shark combo.

1356
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:58,646
That is money in the bank.

1357
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:00,548
Get ready to get a lot of winks.

1358
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:01,816
Okay.

1359
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:03,518
But, um, something else.

1360
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:04,886
Cheryl Melhoff...

1361
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:06,788
she's not on here anymore.

1362
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:08,523
Withdrawn.

1363
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:10,525
Really?

1364
01:22:10,526 --> 01:22:11,526
Yeah.

1365
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:13,528
Hey, man, where are you now?

1366
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:14,696
Himalayas.

1367
01:22:14,697 --> 01:22:16,297
The Himalayas.

1368
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:18,433
I love it.
Wait a minute...

1369
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,901
that is a kick-ass "Been There. "

1370
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:21,836
Todd, I'm gonna keep this short.

1371
01:22:21,837 --> 01:22:23,905
I have to make oxygen choices.

1372
01:22:23,906 --> 01:22:25,840
Hey, I get it. Go!

1373
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:27,875
Anyway, you have a profile now.

1374
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,677
Congratulations.

1375
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:31,713
Cool, but... you know what?

1376
01:22:31,714 --> 01:22:33,014
Would you take me off?

1377
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:35,516
I can't really
swing that $500 yearly.

1378
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,951
Hey.

1379
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,587
Um... well...

1380
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:41,489
Hey, man.

1381
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,790
You're sure?
'Cause I feel like

1382
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,459
we're really onto something here.

1383
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,462
I mean, this is... Do
you mind? I'm working.

1384
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,597
This is one of the best
profiles I've ever done, and...

1385
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:50,999
and our refund policy, well,
you know, we don't have one...

1386
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,566
Todd, I gotta go.

1387
01:22:55,336 --> 01:22:56,337
Sean.

1388
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,405
Yeah.

1389
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:05,812
It's... it's Walter.

1390
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,486
Mitty.

1391
01:23:21,362 --> 01:23:22,497
Walter Mitty.

1392
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:24,564
Seriously?

1393
01:23:26,834 --> 01:23:29,370
How the hell did you get up here?

1394
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,571
I just...

1395
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,844
I've been looking for you.

1396
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:42,983
Sit down.

1397
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:49,823
I'll sit.

1398
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:58,700
Well, take your time.

1399
01:23:58,701 --> 01:23:59,734
Settle in.

1400
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:01,635
Try to be real still, okay?

1401
01:24:03,037 --> 01:24:06,774
There's a snow leopard.

1402
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,708
Right in this ridge.

1403
01:24:10,411 --> 01:24:12,947
So we have to try to be
very, very, very, very still.

1404
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:19,052
They call the snow leopard
the "ghost cat. "

1405
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:23,490
It never lets itself be seen.

1406
01:24:28,529 --> 01:24:30,597
Ghost cat?

1407
01:24:33,634 --> 01:24:36,470
Beautiful things don't
ask for attention.

1408
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,646
Sean, there was a...

1409
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:49,717
negative that got
separated from your roll.

1410
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:53,121
I'm taking a lot
of heat over it at work.

1411
01:24:53,122 --> 01:24:57,091
It never came with
the roll that you sent.

1412
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:59,460
The last roll
you're talking about?

1413
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:01,161
Yeah.
The 25.

1414
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,831
Yeah.

1415
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:08,635
You're sitting on it.

1416
01:25:10,838 --> 01:25:13,841
Why am I sitting on it?

1417
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,944
It's in your wallet.

1418
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,746
That was the gift.

1419
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:20,915
The photograph.

1420
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:22,984
The wallet was just something
I could put it in.

1421
01:25:22,985 --> 01:25:24,685
So I put it in a little slot,

1422
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,888
the little picture
holder in there.

1423
01:25:26,889 --> 01:25:29,556
I thought it'd be cute.

1424
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,927
I told you, "Look inside. "

1425
01:25:32,928 --> 01:25:35,163
In the note.

1426
01:25:35,164 --> 01:25:36,764
You said, "Look inside. "

1427
01:25:36,765 --> 01:25:38,499
I thought you meant,
I thought you meant

1428
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,034
look inside
of the wrapping paper.

1429
01:25:40,035 --> 01:25:43,104
Yeah? Well, you got a real
nice surprise coming.

1430
01:25:43,105 --> 01:25:44,906
No, I don't have it.

1431
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:47,542
I don't have it anymore.

1432
01:25:47,543 --> 01:25:49,644
Whoa.

1433
01:25:54,615 --> 01:25:56,716
What the hell were you thinking?

1434
01:25:58,553 --> 01:25:59,921
I mean, I-I'm sorry,

1435
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:01,956
I've admired you
for a very long time,

1436
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:04,525
but that is not
a good move, at all,

1437
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:05,860
with a valuable negative.

1438
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:08,696
Sorry, I just...
I- I thought it would be

1439
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:10,631
a playful kind of thing.

1440
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:13,134
Playful?

1441
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:15,068
Too playful.

1442
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:17,839
I see what you're saying.

1443
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,575
With the cover, I should have
been more straightforward.

1444
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:23,276
But can I ask you?
I mean, if you don't mind...

1445
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:26,514
what did you do with the wallet?

1446
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:29,215
Chucked it.

1447
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:32,786
Well, that hurts my feelings.

1448
01:26:34,555 --> 01:26:36,824
No... man, I liked it
very much.

1449
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:38,092
I appreciated it very much.

1450
01:26:38,093 --> 01:26:39,227
So you threw it away?

1451
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:41,094
I...

1452
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:46,133
So you have no idea what it was.

1453
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:48,735
The photograph.

1454
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:53,707
It's a shame.

1455
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:58,912
It was a beauty.

1456
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:15,997
How'd you find me, anyway?

1457
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:21,736
My mom.

1458
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:22,904
Cool lady.

1459
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:24,972
Knows how to bake.

1460
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:27,040
Yeah.

1461
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:30,011
Hey, why did you...?

1462
01:27:30,012 --> 01:27:31,978
Shh.

1463
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:09,716
When are you gonna take it?

1464
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,257
Sometimes I don't.

1465
01:28:16,258 --> 01:28:18,693
If I like a moment...

1466
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:24,265
I mean, me, personally...

1467
01:28:24,266 --> 01:28:27,000
I don't like to have
the distraction of the camera.

1468
01:28:31,038 --> 01:28:34,441
I just want to stay... in it.

1469
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:40,213
Stay in it?

1470
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:44,251
Yeah, right there.

1471
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:46,352
Right here.

1472
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:51,491
Now it's gone. It's gone.

1473
01:28:58,099 --> 01:28:59,700
That looks like fun.

1474
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:01,067
I think I'm gonna jump in.

1475
01:29:02,303 --> 01:29:05,339
Hey, what-what was
the picture, Sean?

1476
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,375
We're going to be odd-numbered
if you don't join.

1477
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:13,014
What was the picture?

1478
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:16,684
Let's just call it
a ghost cat, Walter Mitty.

1479
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:06,227
You made the watch list.

1480
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:08,129
How'd you get to Afghanistan?

1481
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,363
There's a travel ban.

1482
01:31:09,364 --> 01:31:12,298
Through Yemen.

1483
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:15,369
Violent place.

1484
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:18,839
That's why
the air fare's only $84.

1485
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,341
Can I have my fife back?

1486
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:25,379
Do you know
anyone in Los Angeles?

1487
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:27,314
No.
Any acquaintances? Okay.

1488
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,083
Any companions?

1489
01:31:29,084 --> 01:31:30,851
Anybody here
who might be able to verify

1490
01:31:30,852 --> 01:31:32,385
that you're Walter Mitty?

1491
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:44,398
Walter Mitty?

1492
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:45,833
Yeah.

1493
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:48,969
Todd Maher, eHarmony.

1494
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:51,005
Hey.

1495
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,907
Thank you.

1496
01:31:52,908 --> 01:31:54,441
Thanks. I really...
What?

1497
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:56,076
Come here, come here.

1498
01:31:56,077 --> 01:31:58,412
Backpack.

1499
01:31:58,413 --> 01:32:00,881
Big hug!

1500
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:02,249
Airport prison?

1501
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:03,450
Yeah.
Yeah?

1502
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:05,252
Tell me all about it
over a Cinnabon.

1503
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:07,121
Come on, Cinnabon.

1504
01:32:08,423 --> 01:32:09,924
<i>How long were you</i>

1505
01:32:09,925 --> 01:32:12,426
detained for, by the way?

1506
01:32:12,427 --> 01:32:14,261
Like, 17 hours.

1507
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:15,996
Wow.

1508
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:17,198
How's that Cinnabon taste?

1509
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,133
Really great.
That's like...

1510
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:21,001
That's frosted heroin.
That's what you're eating.

1511
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:23,070
My friend, that's what you're
having right there, man.

1512
01:32:23,071 --> 01:32:24,305
It's good.

1513
01:32:24,306 --> 01:32:25,606
By the way,

1514
01:32:25,607 --> 01:32:27,174
you got 300 winks

1515
01:32:27,175 --> 01:32:29,210
before I took down your profile.

1516
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:31,078
Three... in, like,
the space of two hours.

1517
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:32,279
It was crazy.

1518
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,148
I thought I was selling
concert tickets.

1519
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:36,283
I never checked.

1520
01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:38,519
Because of the,

1521
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,322
the-the pina colada girl
that quit?

1522
01:32:41,323 --> 01:32:43,157
Yeah.

1523
01:32:43,158 --> 01:32:45,291
Yeah, Cheryl.

1524
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,295
Cheryl, who...

1525
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:50,197
did not respond to a single wink

1526
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:52,299
the whole time she was on there.

1527
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,268
That's a choosy lady.

1528
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:00,241
How's the,

1529
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:03,743
daydreaming going?

1530
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,115
Lately, less.

1531
01:33:08,116 --> 01:33:10,417
Good.

1532
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:12,353
Less is good.

1533
01:33:12,354 --> 01:33:14,521
Thanks for the pastry.

1534
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:16,624
Yeah, well, you owe me.

1535
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:19,292
I'll send you a check
as soon as I sell the piano.

1536
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:23,397
You have a lot on your plate.

1537
01:33:23,398 --> 01:33:26,166
What are you gonna do now?

1538
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:28,267
Go out and get another job.

1539
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:34,440
Boom.

1540
01:33:35,609 --> 01:33:38,279
I'm sorry, Walter, I just...
What?

1541
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,247
You are so not
how I pictured you.

1542
01:33:40,248 --> 01:33:43,083
What-what?
How-how did you picture me?

1543
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:45,486
I pictured you
as a little gray piece of paper,

1544
01:33:45,487 --> 01:33:47,521
but now I see you

1545
01:33:47,522 --> 01:33:50,391
and it's like Indiana Jones
decided to become

1546
01:33:50,392 --> 01:33:52,960
the lead singer of the Strokes
or something like that.

1547
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:55,028
It's nuts, I know.

1548
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:16,450
Sorry, Mom.

1549
01:34:16,451 --> 01:34:17,985
What for?

1550
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,620
Dad bought it for you.

1551
01:34:19,621 --> 01:34:21,121
It was my responsibility.

1552
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:23,023
Walter.

1553
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:24,425
We're all grown here.

1554
01:34:24,426 --> 01:34:26,526
We're all good.

1555
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:51,285
Ooh, that's heavy-duty,
that sum.

1556
01:34:51,286 --> 01:34:53,320
You should put this
in your wallet.

1557
01:34:53,321 --> 01:34:55,122
I don't have one.

1558
01:35:05,065 --> 01:35:06,400
Found it in the trash.

1559
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:09,335
I always save your knickknacks.

1560
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:16,342
Thanks.

1561
01:35:18,445 --> 01:35:20,414
Got it, Mom?
Got it.

1562
01:35:20,415 --> 01:35:22,482
Watch the stairs.

1563
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,195
I think this works.

1564
01:36:08,196 --> 01:36:09,763
Heart of America,
different generations,

1565
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:11,365
this says it all.

1566
01:36:11,366 --> 01:36:13,367
Hey, welcome.

1567
01:36:13,368 --> 01:36:15,736
Wait, I'm sorry, not welcome,

1568
01:36:15,737 --> 01:36:17,771
not an employee.

1569
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,839
Sorry.

1570
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:26,712
There's the picture
Sean wanted... 25.

1571
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:32,852
You have two days
to print for cover.

1572
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:36,923
There's your quintessence.

1573
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:42,728
Hey.

1574
01:36:44,398 --> 01:36:46,432
Do you know our motto?

1575
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:51,305
<i>LIFE.</i>

1576
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:53,906
I'm lovin' it.

1577
01:36:55,275 --> 01:36:57,211
That's... no.

1578
01:36:57,212 --> 01:36:59,345
That's-that's McDonald's.

1579
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:03,717
This thing that you do,

1580
01:37:03,718 --> 01:37:05,352
Ted, where you come into a place

1581
01:37:05,353 --> 01:37:06,719
and you push people out...

1582
01:37:08,388 --> 01:37:10,157
you should know that those people

1583
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:12,325
worked really hard
to build this magazine.

1584
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:16,763
They believed in the motto.

1585
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:18,899
And I get it,
you got your marching orders,

1586
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:22,336
and you have to do
what you have to do,

1587
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:25,871
but you don't have
to be such a dick.

1588
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:30,444
Put that on a plaque

1589
01:37:30,445 --> 01:37:32,678
and hang it at your next job.

1590
01:37:44,591 --> 01:37:45,726
What was it?

1591
01:37:45,727 --> 01:37:47,594
Sasquatch? A unicorn?

1592
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:48,595
The negative?

1593
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:49,796
Yeah.

1594
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:51,331
I didn't look.

1595
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:58,971
You were a good boss, Walter.

1596
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:02,708
Thanks, man.

1597
01:38:06,613 --> 01:38:08,514
Thanks.

1598
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:22,889
Hey, Walter, what's up?

1599
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:24,924
Check this out.

1600
01:39:36,903 --> 01:39:38,905
See you!

1601
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:40,973
Hi.

1602
01:39:52,452 --> 01:39:54,520
Walter Mitty, severance package.

1603
01:40:36,496 --> 01:40:38,432
Hey!

1604
01:40:38,433 --> 01:40:40,099
Cheryl!

1605
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:43,937
Hey.
Hey. Hey.

1606
01:40:43,938 --> 01:40:46,340
I got that e-mail
from Rich yesterday.

1607
01:40:46,341 --> 01:40:47,674
He's really good.

1608
01:40:47,675 --> 01:40:49,509
Walter, thank you.

1609
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:50,777
That was... that...

1610
01:40:50,778 --> 01:40:54,047
that was just
a really cool thing to do.

1611
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,783
I just saw it in Iceland.

1612
01:40:56,784 --> 01:40:59,519
He loves it, and I'm
taking him this afternoon.

1613
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,953
Cool.

1614
01:41:02,422 --> 01:41:04,791
Hey, I wanted you to know

1615
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:06,827
you weren't boring me.

1616
01:41:06,828 --> 01:41:08,961
That day in the park...

1617
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:11,664
I- I was...

1618
01:41:12,532 --> 01:41:13,934
I was thinking about...

1619
01:41:13,935 --> 01:41:15,869
I hope this doesn't
sound weird, but...

1620
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:18,204
I was thinking about you.

1621
01:41:19,806 --> 01:41:23,477
When I was in Greenland...
they do karaoke there,

1622
01:41:23,478 --> 01:41:26,947
and I had to get
on this helicopter

1623
01:41:26,948 --> 01:41:29,116
with a very drunk pilot,

1624
01:41:29,117 --> 01:41:32,953
and I started to imagine you

1625
01:41:32,954 --> 01:41:35,187
singing "Major Tom. "

1626
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:40,594
Anyway,

1627
01:41:40,595 --> 01:41:42,729
it got me on the helicopter,

1628
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:44,831
and it just...

1629
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,600
got me where I wanted to go.

1630
01:41:49,536 --> 01:41:50,971
So what happened to you?

1631
01:41:50,972 --> 01:41:54,474
You sort of fell
off the face of the earth there

1632
01:41:54,475 --> 01:41:56,510
for a little bit.

1633
01:41:56,511 --> 01:41:58,145
I came by, and I...

1634
01:41:58,146 --> 01:42:01,882
your husband answered,
so I figured I should just go.

1635
01:42:01,883 --> 01:42:03,583
Phil.

1636
01:42:03,584 --> 01:42:05,919
He was fixing my refrigerator,

1637
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,588
and he's not my husband.

1638
01:42:08,589 --> 01:42:11,757
I guess I imagined that...

1639
01:42:13,126 --> 01:42:15,996
I thought maybe you
got back together.

1640
01:42:15,997 --> 01:42:18,565
You have a good imagination,

1641
01:42:18,566 --> 01:42:20,633
but no.

1642
01:42:22,569 --> 01:42:25,138
<i>Hey, my sister got
this role in Grease.</i>

1643
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:26,940
Rizzo.

1644
01:42:26,941 --> 01:42:29,742
Not on Broadway;
in some weird church.

1645
01:42:31,611 --> 01:42:34,815
Do you want to go with me?

1646
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:36,616
I made that sound
really not good, but...

1647
01:42:36,617 --> 01:42:37,750
Yeah.

1648
01:42:38,718 --> 01:42:40,187
Yeah?

1649
01:42:40,188 --> 01:42:41,621
Yeah, yeah.

1650
01:42:41,622 --> 01:42:43,190
I would love to.

1651
01:42:43,191 --> 01:42:44,891
<i>Grease in a weird church?</i>

1652
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:46,593
You kidding?

1653
01:42:46,594 --> 01:42:48,895
Rizzo, that's...
that's the best part.

1654
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:50,764
Yeah, Rizzo.

1655
01:42:50,765 --> 01:42:52,132
Tough and tender.

1656
01:42:52,133 --> 01:42:54,067
Yeah.

1657
01:42:54,068 --> 01:42:55,902
Great.

1658
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:58,138
Are you... are
you heading uptown?

1659
01:42:58,139 --> 01:43:00,140
Sure.

1660
01:43:00,141 --> 01:43:01,941
Yeah?
Yeah.

1661
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:05,812
I actually always
related to Rizzo more.

1662
01:43:05,813 --> 01:43:07,180
Yeah?
Yeah.

1663
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:10,116
Was it the, smoking
and the teenage sex?

1664
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:13,153
No, she was just real, I guess.

1665
01:43:15,056 --> 01:43:16,890
The last issue,
it should be here.

1666
01:43:16,891 --> 01:43:19,258
It came out this morning.

1667
01:43:38,812 --> 01:43:40,879
Man, Walter.

1668
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,168
Should we go buy one of those?

1669
01:44:02,169 --> 01:44:03,970
Yeah, I was probably gonna...

1670
01:44:03,971 --> 01:44:06,273
Probably gonna go back later?
Yeah, yeah.

1671
01:44:06,274 --> 01:44:10,109
I just didn't want to seem
uncool and get one right away.

1672
01:44:11,305 --> 01:44:17,397
